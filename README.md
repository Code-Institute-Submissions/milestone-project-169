## Advanture Club website
I have decided to make this website thinking about the unoffical community that me and my friends build 
in order to travel togather and do different kind social acitivies.I took inspiration from alot of travel and 
community websites but I have made the website in my own custom styling and theme.I have made up some most of information
in order to make the website more realistic.

#### Theme and Style
I have used 3 fonts for the Website EXO, ROBOTO and LONG CHAG, all of them are Google fonts.I have made the 
theme of this website linear-gradient with black and blue which made the website bit mystery and very eye catching.
Also added wave pictures to match with linnear-gradient look.Most of the font colors are white in the gradient areas which makes
easy for users to read easily.
#### Navigation Bar
I have used Bootstrap navbar layout for my navigation bar but I have customized it with Club logo and Customize the navbar so that it doesnt look
like typical bootstrap navbar.I have matched the linnear-gradiet theme color with the navbar color so that it look eye catching.
#  Footer 
In Footer has three sections Soical Media section, Motivator and Contact details.I have Font Awesome icons within circles and put the  background color of the 
icon blue to match the Theme.Added Hover effect on the social media icons.
#### Home page
Home page has  a carosel displaying images with the Reasons to join the Adventure Club.I have put a banner along a with a signup botton with follows to the
sign-up form.Also home page has a testimonial section where current member gave their testimonals.I have put the images of the members in a circle along with
a border on the top which make that section look symentic.
