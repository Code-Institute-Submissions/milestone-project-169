## Advanture Club website
I have decided to make this website thinking about the unoffical community that me and my friends build 
in order to travel togather and do different kind social acitivies.I took inspiration from alot of travel and 
community websites but I have made the website in my own custom styling and theme.I have made up some most of information
in order to make the website more realistic.

## User Experience Goals
My goal with this website is to make easy the people are living near by the area or far, 
can know the Advanture Club,its activities and become a member of the club easily. With 
this website people will find out what activities are done in the club and what are the common goal of this club and 
who runs the club.
This website is about a community where people from different background,class and different occupation comes 
togather for one common goal is to find Adventure.With this website you can join the community , 
find out about the acitivies and make new friends.

## website section
#### Theme and Style
I have used 3 fonts for the Website EXO, ROBOTO and LONG CHAG, all of them are Google fonts.I have made the 
theme of this website linear-gradient with black and blue which made the website bit mystery and very eye catching.
Also added wave pictures to match with linnear-gradient look.Most of the font colors are white in the gradient areas which makes
easy for users to read easily.
#### Navigation Bar
I have used Bootstrap navbar layout for my navigation bar but I have customized it with Club logo and Customize the navbar so that it doesnt look
like typical bootstrap navbar.I have matched the linnear-gradiet theme color with the navbar color so that it look eye catching.
#### Footer 
In Footer has three sections Soical Media section, Motivator and Contact details.I have Font Awesome icons within circles and put the  background color of the 
icon blue to match the Theme.Added Hover effect on the social media icons.
#### Home page
Home page has  a carosel displaying images with the Reasons to join the Adventure Club.I have put a banner along a with a signup botton with follows to the
sign-up form.Also home page has a testimonial section where current member gave their testimonals.I have put the images of the members in a circle along with
a border on the top which make that section look symentic.
#### About us
In About us I have put the describtion of the club. Below the describtion I have put the board member details along with pictures.I have added a hover effect on the picture of the members which will rise up and add color to the picture.Also added hover effect on more info.Clicking more info will extend the detail of the member.Also added the font family of Long chag it will look more amazing.
#### Gallery 
I have added picture using flex box in order to make the pictures more responsive.Also I have added the hover effect on the pictures which will make images bigger and rise up.

## Issues and Troubleshooting
- **Drop down navbar in mobile view** I was struggling with how can I make dropdown navbar in mobiles.I googled it and 
found the solution in Bootstrap Documentation
- **Changing color of default bootsrap navbar color** It took me while to get use to the changing color of default bootstrap colors.
I went back to previous lessons again and again to get use to the process
- **Difficulty changing the length and width of the Carosel/image slider** I had alot difficulties to maintaining same size of the images of Carosel.
I seached in google alot for this problem and finally I got the solution I have targeted the image class and put same height.
 - **Carosel olverlay** The texts in the carosel was not clearly visiable when I first tried to put text in the carosel.After alot of search I found out
 about the overlay to create layer of shadow in the carosel/image slider.
 - **Difficulting make the image round and puting it in round border** making the images round and put them in border circle was difficult in the beginning.
 I have googled alot and also took help from Chrome Dev tools by trail and error.
 - **Deciding the background color** I had spent alot of time deciding the background color of Navbar,Banner and Footer.As I have chosen Linear-gradient 
 I had  to come up with a good combination of colors to make the effect look smooth.Had to do alot of trial and error in Chrome Dev tools.
 - **Hover effect** I was little bit confused how to use hover effect perfectly.As I prograss with project and got alot of help from W3Schools ,
 I have become more confident at using hover effect.
 - **Using Flexbox** I had a alot trouble arrannging the gallery.After alot time spent with css grid,
 I have decided to use flex box which more easy to use and more responsive

## Conclusion 
I would like to thank you for paitently reading and reviewing my the accompanying documentation for my first milestone project.I have learnt alot from this project.
Previously I only knew the concepts of HTML and Css but My skills weren't put in test.With this project I get to impliment my learning and also discover my lack-ins and
then overcome those lack-ins.I have felt challenged and proud to have overcome most of the setbacks I have faced during this project.I think I have given my current best 
to this project but I will definately continue to improve myself as developer each by learning more.I look forward to the second milestone project to learn more and
develop more.
