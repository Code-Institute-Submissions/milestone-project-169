## Advanture Club website
I have decided to make this website thinking about the unoffical community that me and my friends build 
in order to travel togather and do different kind social acitivies.I took inspiration from alot of travel and 
community websites but I have made the website in my own custom styling and theme.I have made up some most of information
in order to make the website more realistic.

## User Experience Goals
My goal with this website is to make easy the people are living near by the area or far,

this website people will find out what activities are done in the club and what are the common goal of this club and

This website is about a community where people from different background,class and different occupation comes 
togather for one common goal is to find Adventure.With this website you can join the community ,

#### Theme and Style
I have used 3 fonts for the Website EXO, ROBOTO and LONG CHAG, all of them are Google fonts.I have made the 
theme of this website linear-gradient with black and blue which made the website bit mystery and very eye catching.
Also added wave pictures to match with linnear-gradient look.Most of the font colors are white in the gradient areas which makes
easy for users to read easily.
